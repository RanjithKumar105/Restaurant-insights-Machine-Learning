# 📌 Restaurant Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

This project consists of **four tasks (Task 1–4)** focused on data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning model building, and evaluation using a restaurant dataset. This README summarizes the objectives, methods, and outputs for each task.

---

## ⭐ Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings

### Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the **aggregate restaurant rating** based on given features.

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and handled missing values.
2. Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Selected a regression model (Linear Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest).
5. Trained the model.
6. Evaluated using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared (R²)

### Output
- Cleaned dataset  
- Trained regression model  
- Evaluation report (MSE, R²)

## ⭐ Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System

### Objective
Build a **content-based restaurant recommendation model**.

### Steps Performed
1. Selected features such as cuisines, location, and rating.
2. Created a TF-IDF matrix for text analysis.
3. Computed similarity scores using cosine similarity.
4. Built a function to return top recommendations.

### Output
- TF-IDF matrix  
- Cosine similarity matrix  
- Recommendation results

## ⭐ Task 3: Location-Based Geographical Analysis

### Objective
Analyze **restaurant distribution by location** using latitude and longitude.

### Steps Performed
1. Visualized restaurant coordinates on a map.
2. Grouped restaurants by city and locality.
3. Created statistical summaries:
   - Restaurant count per location
   - Average rating per location
4. Generated visual plots:
   - Lat-long scatter plot
   - Bar charts for cities/localities

### Output
- Geographic maps  
- Locality-wise analysis tables  
- Visual plots

## ⭐ Task 4: Sentiment Analysis of Reviews

### Objective
Perform **sentiment analysis** on restaurant reviews.

### Steps Performed
1. Extracted text reviews.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed text (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization).
3. Used TextBlob/Vader for sentiment scoring.
4. Classified reviews into:
   - Positive
   - Neutral
   - Negative
5. Calculated sentiment distribution.

### Output
- Cleaned review text  
- Sentiment predictions  
- Sentiment distribution plot
